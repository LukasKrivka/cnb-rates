# Czech National Bank (CNB) official foreign exchange rates scraper

The official exchange rates for CZK can be found at https://www.cnb.cz/cs/financni-trhy/devizovy-trh/kurzy-devizoveho-trhu/kurzy-devizoveho-trhu/rok_form.html
This script scrapes the data for a custom time range, as long as the requested years are available (currently 1991 - 2023).

The requirements are python 3+ (development version 3.9.6 should be guaranteed to work) and packages listed in requirements.txt 
(pandas, requests and dependencies).

The script can be used as separate mini-module, which is why the __init__.py file is included. To import it, 
make sure the module's directory is included in PYTHONPATH. More in practical information on this is in notes.txt.

The main.py file shows en example how it could be used to export the data to csv file

## Black Box Solution
For those that are not interested in the inner workings or even do not want to understand and simply need the output, 
there is a prepared blackbox solution for MacOS/Linux. This might require installing developer-tools, xcode or similar.

* In the Terminal application, verify that git is installed, by running:
```bash
which git
```
This should output something like: _usr/bin/git_. If so, proceed to the next step.

If the output says _git not found_, **git** is not installed. Possible fix with **homebrew**:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
followed by:
```bash
brew install git
```
The installation of **homebrew** might take a minute. You will be prompted for your password.

* Next, make a clone of this repository:
This default solution will create a folder in your Desktop, where everything happens
```bash
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/LukasKrivka/CNB-rates
```

* Finally, run a prepared bash script.
```bash
cd CNB-rates
bash simple_run.sh
```
This will handle everything else (python environment, packages, and execution).
The default option for this method is filled dataset - which means the missing dates (weekends etc.) 
are going to be filled with previous value.
The exported csv should appear on your Desktop. Then you can delete the CNB-rates cloned file to clean up.

#### OR
The entire repository can be downloaded as zipfile by adding '/zipball/master/' to the end of the github link in browser.
Then the automatic execution can be run with
```bash
cd Downloads
open LukasKrivka-CNB-rates-SUFFIX.zip
cd LukasKrivka-CNB-rates-SUFFIX
bash simple_run.sh
```
The SUFFIX in the file name will be unique - you need to change it to the name of your particular file name.

## Final remarks:
This script was developed mainly for my own needs. I am not necessarily planing on extending or updating functionality
or maintaining support for subsequent dependencies releases. Noting in this script or reposiory is guaranteed.
