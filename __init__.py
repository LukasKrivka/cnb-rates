"""The Rates class downloads official exchange rates from the website of Czech National Bank for given year(s).

The possible time range to extract the data is from 1991 (including) until the current year.
The class provides methods to extrack rates for specific currencies or a specific time range. 
It can handle missing data by taking the closest previous exchange rate, which is considered to be a valid exchange rate 
for weekends and holidays when the national bank does not publish new data.

The class does not implement other functionalities like loading to and from database. For the most part, 
experienced users will use it only to scrape the data and save them in csv format."""
